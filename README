This source code package includes the MATLAB source codes for the ship wake detection
	via sparse regularisation by using the GMC penalty function.

This package includes three folders:

	1) images		: Stores images for ship wake detection operation. We have only shared an example
		test image from TerraSAR-X products with name: testImage.mat.
		
	2) saved data		: Stores inverse problem solution as a .mat file.
	
	3) source functions	: Stores three source functions:
	
		3.1) radonT.m
		
		3.2) confirmedHalflines.m
		
		3.3) GMC_regularisation.m

and two main MATLAB scripts:

	1) IP_Solve.m
	
	2) shipWakeDetection.m
